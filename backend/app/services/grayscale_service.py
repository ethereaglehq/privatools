    Pass 1 handles embedded *images*. Pass 2 exists for coloured *text and

    rasterise the page, which destroys the text layer, the structure tree and
    the file size along with the colour.

    So it should only run when there is actually coloured marking content.
    This walks the content streams looking for a colour operator with non-gray
    operands:

      r g b  rg/RG   -> coloured unless r == g == b
      c m y k  k/K   -> coloured unless c == m == y == 0 (pure black channel)
      cs/CS + sc/scn -> coloured if the space is DeviceRGB/DeviceCMYK

    Deliberately conservative: anything unparseable returns True, which keeps
    the old rasterising behaviour. A wrong answer must never leave colour in
    the output — it may only cost us the optimisation.
