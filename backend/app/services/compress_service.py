"""PDF compression using pikepdf with improved quality settings.

Uses pikepdf object-stream compression + per-image JPEG re-encoding. We
deliberately do NOT shell out to Ghostscript: the deploy VM does not
guarantee a `gs` binary, and pikepdf's pure-Python path is predictable
and fast enough for the upload sizes the frontend permits (≤500 MB).

Presets (`light` / `recommended` / `extreme`) map to user-facing labels
in the React UI. `custom` lets the slider override quality + max dim
without touching the preset table.
