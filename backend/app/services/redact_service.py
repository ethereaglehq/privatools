"""Permanent redaction, with statutory exemption codes stamped on each box.

Plain black boxes are enough for "hide this". They are not enough for a FOIA or
Privacy Act production, where every withholding has to be *justified* — the
released page carries the citation authorising it, and the producing party
keeps a log of what was withheld under which exemption.

Adobe is the only competitor that does this; DocHub, PDFescape, Foxit, Nitro,
TinyWow, LightPDF and ihatepdf.cv all stop at the black box. It costs us a
`code` field per rectangle and a summary, and it turns the tool from "hides
things" into something usable for the work redaction actually exists for.
