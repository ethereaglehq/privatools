"""Bates numbering — stamping, continuous multi-file sequences, and removal.

Bates numbers exist to give a document production a single unbroken index: in a
legal production, page 1 of the first file and the last page of the last file
are ends of *one* sequence, not per-file sequences that each restart. The
original implementation numbered each file from `start_number` independently,
which makes the output unusable for the audience the tool is for.

`add_bates_numbering_batch` maintains the running counter across files and
returns a manifest of which range landed on which file — the production log a
paralegal would otherwise reconstruct by hand.

# cost within a fifth: a page of text with 1,280 candidates was charged 30 s
