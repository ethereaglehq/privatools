"""Private sanitize subprocess protocol; the web process never parses the upload.

sanitize_service runs ``python -I this_file <input pdf> <output pdf>``. Only
JSON is written to stdout: ``{"ok": true}`` once the output is saved, or
``{"ok": false, "error": ...}`` naming "password", "corrupt",
"unreadable_content", "too_large" or "failed".

What goes:

- document JavaScript (the /Names JavaScript tree and a script /OpenAction)
  and every additional-actions (/AA) dictionary: document, page, annotation
  and form-field events;
- every action other than moving within the document, resetting a form or
  opening an http, https or mailto link, wherever an action can fire: on
  every reachable dictionary or stream that holds one, whether a link,
  widget, form field, bookmark or anything else, and along each /Next
  chain. The open action, which runs without a click, keeps only moves
  within the document. That covers Launch, JavaScript, GoToR, GoToE,
  SubmitForm, ImportData, media and 3D actions, and URIs such as javascript:
  or file:;
- embedded files: the EmbeddedFiles tree, file attachment annotations,
  associated files (/AF), portfolio (/Collection) settings and the embedded
  file streams of any file specification;
- page templates (/Names /Templates), which only scripts use;
- sound, movie, screen, rich media and 3D annotations;
- XFA form data. AcroForm fields stay fillable and keep their values;
- content in optional-content layers that are hidden when the file opens,
  whether in page contents, form XObjects, annotation appearances, tiling
  patterns, Type 3 glyphs or soft masks. The visible layers become ordinary
  page content, so nothing hidden is left to switch on;
- XMP metadata streams, wherever they are attached, and the document
  information dictionary.

A password needed to open the file is reported as "password"; an owner
password, which only limits what a reader allows, is kept with its limits.

The limits: what this does grows with what the file expands to, not with its
size. Removing layers decodes and parses every content stream, and a 300 KB
upload can inflate to hundreds of megabytes. So the process caps its own
memory and CPU time in ``_isolate``, the caller stops it after a time limit,
and layered content is measured before it is parsed: content that decodes to
more than MAX_CONTENT_BYTES, or runs the process out of memory, is reported
as "too_large". Layered content that will not parse stops the work as
"unreadable_content", because skipping it would leave its hidden layers in
the file. Every walk is bounded too: shared and cyclic structures are
visited once, so a file built to make one loop cannot.
