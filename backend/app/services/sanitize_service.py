"""Sanitize a PDF in a separate, bounded process.

What goes is listed in ``_sanitize_worker.py``, which does the work. It runs
there, not here, because sanitizing costs what the file expands to rather than
what it weighs: removing layers decodes and parses every content stream, and
every object is walked. A 300 KB upload that inflates to 300 MB took this
process from 61 MB to 689 MB. The worker caps its own memory and CPU time,
this module stops it after a time limit, and the web process never parses the
upload. The signature checker and the QR reader work the same way.
