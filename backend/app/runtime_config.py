"""Runtime (per-deploy) configuration the SPA reads at startup.

The **api-subdomain split** is driven entirely from here. When
``PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`` is set (e.g. ``https://api.privatools.me``), the backend
injects a ``<meta name="privatools:api-base">`` tag into the served
``index.html`` so the *already-built* SPA bundle sends its ``/api`` requests to
that separate origin instead of same-origin — with **no frontend rebuild**.
Empty/unset keeps everything same-origin, so local dev and the current prod are
unchanged until the flag is set.

Why a ``<meta>`` tag and not an inline ``<script>``: the page's CSP uses a
per-request ``script-src`` nonce (no ``unsafe-inline``), so an inline config
script would need nonce handling. A meta tag needs no script-src privilege and
is read once at module load by ``frontend/src/lib/api.ts``.

This module is pure and stdlib-only on purpose: it imports cleanly (and is
unit-testable) without the FastAPI app or its native dependencies.
