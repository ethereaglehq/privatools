"""Shared rate-limiter instance for per-route decorators.

`app.main` builds the FastAPI app, registers the exception handler, and
sets the default global limit. Routes that want a stricter per-route cap
(`@limiter.limit("5/minute")` on expensive jobs like OCR / URL→PDF /
LibreOffice conversions) import :data:`limiter` from this module rather
than from `app.main` — that would create a circular import, because
`app.main` imports every route module at startup.

The limit string is env-configurable so tests / staging can relax it
without code changes. ``RATE_LIMIT`` is the default applied to every
route; ``RATE_LIMIT_EXPENSIVE`` is the cap stamped on individual
heavy-job routes via :data:`EXPENSIVE_RATE_LIMIT`.
