"""Account and API-key endpoints.

Accounts exist so a developer can issue and manage API keys. The tool endpoints
themselves remain usable without one.

The session cookie is `HttpOnly` (script cannot read it), `SameSite=Lax` (not
sent on cross-site POSTs) and `Secure` outside development. Combined with a
JSON-only body — a cross-origin form cannot set `application/json` without
clearing a CORS preflight — that covers CSRF without a token round-trip.

Credential endpoints are rate-limited harder than the global default: these are
the routes worth guessing at.
