"""Cross-origin answers for the site's own pages.

The site's pages run on https://privatools.me and call https://api.privatools.me
(deploy/api-subdomain-split.md), so every answer they read is a cross-origin
one. A browser hands such a page an answer only if it carries
Access-Control-Allow-Origin for the page's origin, and then only the
CORS-safelisted response headers (Content-Type, Content-Length and a few
others) plus those named in Access-Control-Expose-Headers. Any other header
reads as null on the page, and the page carries on without it.
