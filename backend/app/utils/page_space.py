"""Where the drawing tools put things on a page.

The PyMuPDF tools (Redact, White-Out, Annotate, Add Shapes, Form Creator and
eSign) take boxes in points from the top-left corner of the page's visible
area (its CropBox), before any /Rotate setting the page has is applied. The
website's page converts what the visitor draws on its preview into that
(frontend/src/components/tool-ui/pdf/page-coordinates.ts).

What went wrong on turned pages even with the right numbers:

* The libraries read /Rotate differently from the preview. pdf.js, which
  draws the preview, shows /Rotate -90 as 270, 450 as 90, and a value that is
  not a multiple of 90 (80, say) as 0. MuPDF rounds 80 to 90, and pikepdf's
  placement ignores anything but 90, 180 and 270 as written, so boxes landed
  in a frame the visitor never saw. `settle_rotation` writes /Rotate the way
  pdf.js reads it, on the page itself, before anything is placed; the output
  then shows the same way in every viewer.
* PyMuPDF's own drawing (Shape, insert_image, insert_text, and the fill that
  apply_redactions paints) forgets where the visible area starts once the page
  has a /Rotate: Page.transformation_matrix is (1, 0, 0, -1, 0, height) for any
  turned page. On a turned page whose CropBox or MediaBox does not start at
  0,0, a white-out or a redaction's black box landed that far away. With
  /Rotate 0, PyMuPDF uses MuPDF's own matrix, which is right, so the tools draw
  with the page unturned for the moment (PyMuPDF does the same itself when it
  adds text markup, in Page._add_text_marker).
* Things with a direction (a signature, a highlight) were laid along the page
  as stored, so on a page turned a quarter they showed sideways, or ran 57
  points past the box the visitor drew. Signatures now follow the page as
  shown; text markup follows the text under it (`markup_quad`).

Sign PDF and Edit PDF draw with reportlab on a page of their own and lay it
over the PDF page with pikepdf, which keeps it upright as the page is shown.
They take boxes in points from the bottom-left corner of the page as shown.
Their overlay was the size of the MediaBox as stored and was fitted into the
TrimBox, so on a page turned a quarter, or cut by a CropBox, everything
shrank and moved. `shown_area` gives the overlay the size of the page as shown
and the place it is shown in.

backend/tests/test_page_contract.py checks every tool on turned and cropped
pages, including /Rotate written as -90, 450 or 80 and /Rotate inherited from
the page tree.
