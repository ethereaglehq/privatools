"""Process-wide admission control for heavy (CPU/subprocess) work.

The deep research found there is no global cap on concurrent heavy operations:
~6 default-executor threads per worker, several services nest their own pools
inside that, and nothing bounds the total. On the 2-core VM this oversubscribes
under load and the failure mode is a *cliff* (correlated 504/OOM), not a slope.

`run_bounded` gates heavy work behind a process-wide semaphore AND runs it in a
DEDICATED bounded thread pool, separate from asyncio's shared default executor.
Two problems this solves:

1. Admission control. The semaphore is GENEROUS (so normal load never queues) —
   it only engages under a spike, converting cliff-edge collapse into bounded
   queueing. Tune with `MAX_CONCURRENT_HEAVY`.
2. The timed-out-thread leak. When a request times out (or the client
   disconnects), asyncio cancels the awaiting coroutine — but CPython can't kill
   the thread, so the blocking op runs to completion. The admission slot stays
   occupied until that native future completes. In the shared executor it would starve
   *light* `to_thread` work (file copies, small reads) too. Here it only ever
   consumes one of at most `MAX_CONCURRENT_HEAVY` dedicated "heavy" threads, so
   leaked/slow ops degrade into bounded queueing of heavy work and leave the
   rest of the event loop's threads alone.

The semaphore + pool are per-worker (each uvicorn worker imports this module
once) and created lazily on first use.
