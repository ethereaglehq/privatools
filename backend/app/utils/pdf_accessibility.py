"""Carry document-level accessibility properties across tools that rebuild a PDF.

Tools built on `pikepdf.Pdf.new()` (merge, extract-pages) start from an empty
catalog and copy pages in. Page objects carry their own `/Tabs`, but everything
that lives on the *catalog* is silently dropped: `/Lang`, the document title,
`/ViewerPreferences`, and the structure tree.

That is real data loss, not a cosmetic gap. Someone who paid to have a document
remediated for WCAG or Section 508 compliance loses that work by merging it,
and nothing in the output says so. Measured before this helper existed: an
accessible input scoring 96/100 came out of /merge at 39 and /extract-pages
at 39.

What this deliberately does NOT do
----------------------------------
It does not copy `/MarkInfo` or `/StructTreeRoot`. Merging structure trees
correctly means merging the `/K` kid arrays, rewriting every `/ParentTree`
number tree entry, and re-pointing struct elements at their new page objects —
a real piece of work, not a copy. Asserting `/MarkInfo << /Marked true >>` on a
document with no structure tree would be *worse than doing nothing*: it claims
the document is tagged to any tool that asks, when it is not. Better to lose
the tags visibly than to lie about having them.

So the output is honestly "untagged, but keeps its language, title and viewer
preferences" — which recovers most of the score and all of the properties that
can be carried without inventing structure.

# ── structure tree ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The catalog properties above are the cheap half. Carrying the *structure
# tree* is what actually keeps a document tagged, and it is only tractable
# because of one pikepdf behaviour worth stating explicitly:
#
#   `dst.pages.append(src.pages[i])` copies the page through the same
#   object map that `dst.copy_foreign()` uses. So copying the StructTreeRoot
#   *after* the pages have been appended makes every struct element's `/Pg`
#   resolve to the page object already in `dst`, not a duplicate.
#
# The `/Pg` of an element whose page was *not* appended comes out as null, and
# a null `/Pg` reads exactly like no `/Pg`. Pruned after the copy, those
# elements looked page-less and stayed, carrying the text of the pages left
# behind (`/ActualText`, `/Alt`) and, through their OBJRs, those pages'
# annotations. So the tree is pruned in the source first, while every page
# reference is intact, and only then copied: see `utils.page_removal`.
