"""Clerk's origins must reach the account pages and nowhere else.

Clerk needs more of the policy than anything else in this app: its SDK is
script-src, its API is connect-src, its bot check is a Cloudflare Turnstile
iframe (frame-src, which did not exist here before), and its avatars are
img-src. That is a real widening, so it is bounded two ways — to the account
pages, and to hosts Clerk controls.

The wildcard deserves a note. test_byok_csp asserts connect-src is never a
wildcard, and `https://*.protect.clerk.com` is one. That guard exists to keep
`https:` — meaning any host on the internet — out of the policy; a wildcard
bounded to one vendor's domain is still an allowlist, and Clerk documents it
as required. The distinction is enforced below rather than left to a comment.

It also matters that these tests run with Clerk *configured*. The suite's
default environment has no publishable key, so every Clerk branch is skipped
and a test that forgot to set one would pass while proving nothing.
