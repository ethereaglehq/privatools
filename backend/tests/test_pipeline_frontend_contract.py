"""The SPA's server-chainable step list must match the backend catalog exactly.

This guards the specific failure that made `/api/pipeline` useless: the backend
advertised 2 steps, `PipelinePage.tsx` offered 25, nobody noticed, and the SPA
quietly re-uploaded the whole document once per step for months.

`API_PIPELINE_STEPS` in PipelinePage.tsx decides when the SPA takes the
one-request fast path. If it lists a step the backend cannot run, every fast-path
run 400s and silently falls back. If it omits a step the backend CAN run, users
keep paying the per-step upload cost for no reason. Both directions are bugs,
so this asserts equality rather than a subset.
