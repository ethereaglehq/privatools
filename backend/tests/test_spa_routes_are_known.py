"""Every static route the SPA router declares must be a known path.

The SPA middleware answers an unknown path with HTTP 404 so Google does not
flag /tool/nonexistent-slug as a Soft 404. That is right, but it means any
route the frontend adds and the backend has not been told about is served as a
404: React Router still renders it, so the page *looks* fine, and the only
symptoms are the status code, a flash of "Page Not Found" in the tab title,
and crawlers being told the page does not exist.

That shipped. /account, /account/keys, /my-stuff/vault, /status and /support
all 404'd in production — Account and Vault while sitting in the main nav —
because the backend kept its own hand-written tuple of top-level routes and
nobody updated it. CLAUDE.md already warns that page slugs live in several
hand-maintained lists; this makes one of them checkable instead.

Parsed from App.tsx rather than duplicated, because a second copy of the list
is the bug.
