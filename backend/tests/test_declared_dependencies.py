"""Every third-party module the app imports must be a DIRECT dependency.

This exists because of a real outage-shaped bug. `services/
image_watermark_remove_service.py` does `import cv2`, but
`opencv-python-headless` was never listed in the direct requirements (now
requirements.in) — it happened to arrive transitively via rembg, and a comment
in that service even justified the choice on those grounds ("already in the
hashed lock, pulled in by rembg").

rembg 2.0.81 dropped opencv. The lock regenerated cleanly, every hash verified,
CI's own dependency checks stayed green — and the image simply had no cv2, so
the watermark route raised ModuleNotFoundError at import time. Nothing in the
dependency tooling catches this, because from pip's perspective nothing is
wrong: the tree is consistent, it just no longer contains a package we never
asked for.

A transitive dependency is an implementation detail of another package. Relying
on one for a direct import means an unrelated upstream release can delete your
dependency. This test makes that a test failure instead of a 500.
