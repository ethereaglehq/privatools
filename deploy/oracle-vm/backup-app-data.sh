# Nightly backup of the accounts database.
#
# This persists the local account mirror and API-key records. Clerk identity
# recovery does not restore these records; legacy native accounts also depend
# on this database. Keep an encrypted off-host copy and rehearse restoration.
#
# The DB lives in the app-data Docker volume, root-owned on the host, inside a
# container with a read-only root filesystem. So rather than reaching into
# /var/lib/docker, take the snapshot from inside the container into /app/temp
# (a writable volume) and copy it out. sqlite3's VACUUM INTO is WAL-safe: it
# takes a consistent snapshot without locking out the live service, which a
# plain cp of a WAL-mode database would not give us.
#
# Install: deploy/oracle-vm/install-backup.sh
