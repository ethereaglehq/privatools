# PrivaTools — Oracle VM manual deploy of origin/main, built on the VM.
#
# Production normally deploys signed release tags through the auto-deploy
# timer (auto-deploy.sh). This manual path builds main locally instead, for an
# emergency when no release image can be produced. Do not use it as a
# rollback tool: it pulls main and rebuilds. Roll back with
# `privatools-rollout --rollback` (deploy/README.md).
#
# Run it as ubuntu (not with sudo): it uses sudo itself for Docker, and runs
# the rollout as ubuntu with the docker group, like the timer does.
#
# Guarantees:
#   1. `set -euo pipefail` — a failed pull or build stops before anything
#      running is touched.
#   2. Zero downtime — privatools-rollout starts the build beside the running
#      release and moves traffic only after /readyz reports the new commit,
#      real pages serve and its job supervisor holds the queue. A build that
#      fails those checks is removed and the running release keeps serving;
#      there is nothing to roll back.
#   3. One deploy at a time — it holds the auto-deploy timer's lock.
#   4. A log line either way in ~/deploy.log.
#
# The rollout needs the nginx upstream switch installed
# (install-auto-deploy.sh). Apply this script with:
#   scp deploy/oracle-vm/deploy.sh ubuntu@140.245.15.140:/home/ubuntu/deploy.sh.new
#   ssh ubuntu@140.245.15.140 'cp ~/deploy.sh ~/deploy.sh.bak && \
#       mv ~/deploy.sh.new ~/deploy.sh && chmod +x ~/deploy.sh'
