# Installed as /usr/local/bin/privatools-rollout. auto-deploy.sh calls it with
# the cosign-verified digest of a release tag; deploy.sh calls it with a local
# build. It never pulls, builds or verifies anything itself.
#
# Run it as the deploy user, never as root. The timer does; by hand:
#   sudo runuser -u ubuntu -g ubuntu -G docker -- privatools-rollout ...
# It refuses root, because root cannot open the deploy lock the timer owns in
# sticky /tmp (fs.protected_regular) and would leave state the timer cannot use.
#
# The steady state is one container, privatools-privatools-1 on
# 127.0.0.1:8000, exactly as before; the backup, the manual commands in
# deploy/README.md and the CI image probe all rely on that. A rollout passes
# traffic through a temporary second compose project, privatools-interim, on
# 127.0.0.1:8001:
#
#   0. Finish a switch a killed run left half done (renamed, perhaps not
#      reloaded) by re-applying the upstream; otherwise leave the shared nginx
#      alone. If the port the file names has not been ready for
#      RECONCILE_WAIT seconds, fall back only to a canonical container that
#      passes the page probe again, never to an interim that may not have
#      passed the gates. Then retire any leftover interim.
#   1. Start the interim container on the new image beside the live one. Wait
#      for /readyz to report BUILD_SHA and for the real-page probe
#      (scripts/ci/probe-image.py --running) to pass. Hand the async job queue
#      over: the old supervisor finishes its current job, the new one takes
#      the lock and must keep it, without a container restart, for a soak
#      period. Only then switch host nginx to 8001 (nginx -t, graceful reload,
#      and proof that the reload happened) and check through nginx that the
#      new build answers. Otherwise remove the interim and stop: the live
#      release never stopped serving.
#   2. Let the old container finish its in-flight requests, including those
#      nginx's retiring workers still pass to it. A container that still
#      receives requests after those workers exited is never removed.
#   3. Recreate the canonical container on the new image, gate it the same
#      way, hand the queue to it, switch nginx back to 8000, drain the interim
#      and remove it.
#
# The replaced release is recorded before anything destroys it; --rollback
# runs it again the same way, also from the degraded state below.
#
# Exit status:
#   0  BUILD_SHA serves from the canonical container
#   1  the new release was rejected (not ready, broken pages, or its job
#      supervisor could not hold the queue); the previous release serves
#   2  nothing was started, or a host problem undid the attempt (nginx, Docker,
