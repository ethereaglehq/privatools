/**
 * Smart Redact's copy has a harder job than Summarize PDF's.
 *
 * By definition this document contains the personal information the user is
 * trying to remove, so "send it to a third party" is a genuinely consequential
 * choice rather than a convenience one. The UI has to say that plainly, and it
 * also has to say what is actually protected — the values the regex pass found
 * are masked before anything is sent — without letting that reassurance blur
 * the fact that the rest of the text does go.
 *
 * These tests pin both halves. Copy that oversells is how a user makes a
 * decision they would not have made with the facts.
