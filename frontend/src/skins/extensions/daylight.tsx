/**
 * Daylight — extension.
 *
 * Daylight's base is hand-written (src/skins/daylight/SkinApp.tsx), not
 * generated, so unlike the other three there is no markup to splice — the base
 * already renders every surface. What the mixins add here is the *behavior*
 * behind three of them:
 *
 *   withAccounts   `this.state.acct` + the whole account flow (recovery codes,
 *                  the Clerk email-code branch, keys, rotation)
 *   withVault      `this.state.vlt` + the real AES-GCM vault
 *   withRealTools  `renderVals().realToolUI` — the same 112 real tool
 *                  components the house design mounts
 *
 * The base's markup consumes that state directly; nothing is duplicated.
