/**
 * Guard the path→hash bridge that makes the ported designs answer to real URLs.
 *
 * Aurora, Carbon and Structured route on `location.hash`. Everything that
 * addresses them from outside — the nav, the sitemap, Google, a shared link —
 * uses a path. Without the bridge their routers fall through to the default
 * route and every tool URL renders the homepage.
 *
 * The route list is read out of App.tsx rather than restated here, so a route
 * added to the router and forgotten in `pathRoutes.ts` fails this test instead
 * of shipping as a page that silently renders the homepage.
