/**
 * Make a hash-routed design answer to the URLs the rest of the site uses.
 *
 * Aurora and Carbon route internally on `location.hash` — `#/tool/merge-pdf`.
 * Every URL that reaches them from outside is a path: `/tool/merge-pdf`. The
 * house nav links to paths, the sitemap advertises paths, Google indexes paths,
 * and a shared link is a path. With no hash present, their routers fall through
 * to the default route, so **every tool URL rendered the homepage** — the tool
 * itself was never reachable except by clicking through from inside the app.
 *
 * Their prototypes never hit this: navigation was in-app clicks that set state
 * directly, and a URL was never typed, shared or reloaded. Structured had the
 * same class of problem on its own route table and got `withFixedRouting`;
 * these two were left as they were.
 *
 * The bridge is deliberately one-directional. On load, and on any history
 * navigation, an incoming *path* is translated into the hash the design already
 * understands. Nothing rewrites the design's own hash navigation, because that
 * part works — the bug is only in how the outside world addresses it.
