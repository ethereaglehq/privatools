 * The path prefixes a ported design must answer to.
 *
 * These are the URLs the outside world uses to reach a tool: the house nav
 * links to them, the sitemap advertises them, Google indexes them, and a shared
 * link is one of them. A hash-routed design has to translate them — see
 * `withPathRoutes`.
 *
 * Kept next to the skins rather than inside one, because two designs need it
 * and a third may. `pathRoutes.test.ts` checks it against App.tsx's own route
 * declarations, so a route added to the router and forgotten here shows up as a
 * failing test rather than as a tool page that silently renders the homepage.
