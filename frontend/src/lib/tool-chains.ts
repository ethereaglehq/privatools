/**
 * What to offer a user once a tool has finished.
 *
 * `/pipeline` already chains 17 backend steps, and the file-handoff mechanism
 * already moves a file into another tool — but nothing ever offered either from
 * a *result* screen. The chaining existed and was unreachable at the exact
 * moment someone wants it.
 *
 * The competitor audit put this bluntly: DocHub's "what would you like to do
 * with this document?" completion modal was the single best idea in the whole
 * report, and it is the entire benefit of their editor model. This is the
 * stateless version — no account, no storage, just the file already in the
 * browser handed to the next tool.
 *
 * Suggestions carry a reason. "Compress PDF" alone is a menu; "now that pages
 * are merged, shrink the result for email" is an answer.
