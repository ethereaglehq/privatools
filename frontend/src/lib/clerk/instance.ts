/**
 * The Clerk instance, reachable from outside React.
 *
 * Clerk's API is hooks-first, and three of the four skins are class components
 * generated from their design sources — `withAccounts` subclasses them because
 * a subclass is the only edit that survives regeneration. Hooks cannot be used
 * there, and `accountApi` is a plain object by design so those classes can
 * drive it from `setState`.
 *
 * So a component inside <ClerkProvider> parks the instance here and everything
 * else reads it. Deliberately a module variable rather than `window.Clerk`:
 * that global is clerk-js's own business, not a documented contract, and this
 * way the dependency is visible in imports and can be faked in a test.
