/**
 * Clerk is the account provider; it is neither mounted nor downloaded without a key.
 *
 * `clerk init` wrapped <App /> in ClerkProvider unconditionally, which would
 * take the whole site down for anyone building without Clerk keys: the provider
 * throws on a missing publishable key and sits above every route. Wrong blast
 * radius for a feature the site itself calls optional — the README advertises
 * `docker compose up --build` with no configuration, and all
 * tools works signed out.
 *
 * The import is lazy for a second reason. Statically imported, @clerk/react put
 * 124K into the entry chunk — more than doubling it, 108K to 232K — which every
 * visitor to every tool page paid for whether or not the deployment had an
 * identity provider at all. Behind `lazy` it is a separate chunk that a
 * key-less build never requests.
 *
 * The Suspense fallback is null rather than <App />, which would mount the app
 * twice and throw its state away on the swap. Only deployments that configure
 * Clerk take this path, and index.html's pre-paint shell is still on screen
 * while the chunk arrives.
